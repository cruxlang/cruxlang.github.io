Crux is a work in progress.  Roughly, here is its current state:

## Working

- Type inference
- Sum types
- Tuples
- Flow control (if, while, match, for)
- [Row-polymorphic records](https://github.com/cruxlang/crux/blob/master/doc/design/objects.md)
- Type aliases
- Mutable locals and record fields
- Generics, including weak polymorphism under mutability
- Traits
- Modules
- Exceptions
- JS FFI
- Build system

## Not Done

- Standard library
- DOM APIs
- JSX / React integration
- async/await
- Associated types
- Package manager
- Optimizing compiler
- Amazing error messages
- npm package output

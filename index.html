        Crux is a principled, productive programming language that provides
        familiar syntax but does not compromise on rock-solid fundamentals.
      </p>
      <h2>Big Ideas</h2>
      <p>
        Crux is all about small ideas that smoothly fit together without
        clumsy seams or weird corner cases.  Crux is 100% type safe, but
        thanks to bidirectional type inference, you almost never have to
        spell out the names of your types.
      </p>
      <p>
        Crux code integrates directly with existing JavaScript --
        you can build Crux libraries for publishing on npm or use existing
        JavaScript libraries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Crux is sound [TODO: link to soundness page] - never worry about
        missing properties or "undefined is not a function" again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Crux's syntax is designed to be familiar to anyone coming from
        JavaScript or Python.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike other strongly-typed languages that compile to JavaScript,
        like Scala.js or GHCJS or Emscripten, Crux maps directly to ES6 semantics.  This
        means that code written in Crux is as fast as JavaScript or TypeScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, Crux code is often faster [benchmarks needed] than similar
        JavaScript, because methods in Crux are statically-dispatched rather
        than dynamically looked up from an object.  This means you can write
        your code naturally and know that the optimizer will inline short methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Crux has tuples.
      </p>
      <p>
        Iteration uses exactly the same syntax no matter the data structure:
        arrays, immutable arrays, sets, maps, slices, ranges.
      </p>

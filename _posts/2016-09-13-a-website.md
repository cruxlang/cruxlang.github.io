We have a website!  Take a look around and give us your feedback!  Send a Tweet to [@cruxlang](https://twitter.com/cruxlang),
[join Slack](https://cruxlang-slackin.herokuapp.com/), or click the Feedback button in the lower right -- whichever is most
convenient.

Crux is designed to be a modern language that's easy and natural to use, so if anything seems unnatural to you, we'd love to
hear about it.

Thanks!
